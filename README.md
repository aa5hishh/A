#A
As part of an internship project, I built a Telegram bot that lets users search for professional details of public figures using either text or voice input (in English or Hindi). The bot fetches mock data like name, job title, company, and LinkedIn profile using a public API (MockAPI.io), and logs each interaction (timestamp, query, and result) to a connected Google Sheet. The project was developed using Python, Telegram Bot API, SpeechRecognition, and gspread. Itâ€™s a simple example of how automation and AI tools can work together to create interactive, voice-enabled search workflows.
